        <p class="lead">Welcome to my Home page. I was born and raised in Long Beach, California and currently, I am a student at CSULB. Next semester will be my 3rd year at CSULB in the computer science major. The high school that I attended and graduated from was Long Beach Polytechnic Highschool.
Some of my hobbies to enjoy my free time is to go to a gym, play some video games, and play basketball. Some goals I have is to finish and get my bachelor's degree in computer science at CSULB. I also want to explore and participate in serveral internship opportunities.
          I would like to gather as much work experience as possible while balancing out my school time after the pandemic ends in order to have more experience for future computer science job opportunities.
